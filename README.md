## 🚀 Features

- **Bandit** – scans Python code for security issues.
- **Trivy** – scans Docker images for vulnerabilities.
- **Checkov** – scans Terraform/Kubernetes for misconfigurations.
- **ML Simulation** – scores issues to help prioritize remediation.
- **Streamlit UI** – interactive dashboard with severity filters.

## 🔧 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/devsecops_scanner.git
cd devsecops_scanner
````

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You may need to install Trivy and Checkov manually:

```bash
pip install bandit checkov streamlit
```

Ensure Trivy is installed:

```bash
choco install trivy  # On Windows (with Chocolatey)
```

Or download from [https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)

---

## ✅ Usage

### Run all scans and save results

```bash
python main.py
```

This scans:

* Python code in `your_code_to_scan/`
* Docker image in `your_container/`
* Terraform/Kubernetes files in `iac_code/`

### Launch the dashboard

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features

* Filter vulnerabilities by severity (`LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`)
* View results grouped by:

  * Code vulnerabilities (Bandit)
  * Container vulnerabilities (Trivy)
  * IaC issues (Checkov)
* Includes ML-predicted risk scores

---

## 📁 Example `main.tf`

```hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "bad_sg" {
  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

---

## 💡 Customization

* Add more ML logic in `ml_model.py`
* Extend filtering/prioritization logic in `utils.py`
* Connect to CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins) for DevSecOps pipelines
